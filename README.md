# Rize-1

A visual and interactive learning resource for understanding low-level CPU architecture.

[There's a Discord now](https://discord.gg/dmBw9vvC)

## What is Rize-1?

Rize-1 is an educational project designed to help beginners learn about CPU architecture, assembly language, and low-level computing concepts. It features a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed with learning in mind, removing some of the complexities found in real-world architectures while maintaining the core concepts.

## Project Goals

- **Educational First:** Created as the learning resource I wish I had when starting with low-level CPU concepts
- **Visual & Interactive:** Focus on visualization and interactivity over raw performance
- **Approachable:** Designed to be friendly to beginners while still being comprehensive

## Features

- Custom assembly language ("azzembly")
- Visual execution model
- Register-based architecture with clearly defined purpose registers
- Simplified instruction formats for better learning

## Future Plans

- Support Interpreter 'Kernels' that can be chosen to Interpret Real-World Assembly for different Architectures
- Launching from CMD with .azm File as Argument should ideally automatically Load the Program

## Getting Started

*Coming soon*
